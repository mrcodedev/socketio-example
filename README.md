# Socket.io example Server and Client

Little example how to use to create Server and Client, to send data with Websockets :D.

## Usage

First run:

```bash
npm i
```

Before this, first you must execute the server:

```bash
npm run server
```

And now, you must execute the client:

```bash
npm run client
```

You can view a message into server and the client :D.

## Support

If you want to help me improve the example, you can invite me to a coffee and appear as a patron :).
